# Embedded Systems - Shape the World

This repository contains all laboratory assignments completed during the following two part course:
 - [UT.6.10x Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Microcontroller Input/Output](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-microcontroller-i)
 - [UT.6.20x Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Multi-Threaded Interfacing](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-multi-threaded-in)

These courses are part of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) through the Edx platform from The University of Texas at Austin, taught by Dr. Jonathan Valvano and Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi. They feature the development of software in the C programming language on the ARM Cortex M4 processor. 

This is a 16-week course that is split into two parts, a full description of each module can be found in the [syllabus](http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/syllabus.html). 

## Requirements
 - [Keil uVision 4](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm) - Keil uVision integrated development environment (IDE) for the ARM
 - [Test EXecute and Simulate (TExaS)](http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/download.html) - DLL extensions to the Keil uVision IDE that evaluates lab solutions
 - [Tivaâ„¢ C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL) - All labs are written for this microcontroller
